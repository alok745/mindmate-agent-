# 🧠 MindMate – AI Mood Check-in Agent 💬

This project is my submission for the **Kaggle x Google “Agents Intensive – Capstone Project” (Agents for Good)**.  
MindMate is a lightweight AI agent that performs mood detection and provides simple supportive responses to promote mental wellbeing.

---

## 🌟 Overview

MindMate acts as a **friendly check-in agent** that:
- Reads user text input (simulated messages)
- Detects the **mood** → Positive / Neutral / Negative  
- Responds with a small **coping tip**
- Summarizes the user’s mood trend in a **bar chart visualization**

It’s a minimal but meaningful demonstration of how agentic AI can contribute to **mental health awareness** and emotional support.
